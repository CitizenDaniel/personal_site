<p> Kevin Kelly figured out the thing that I thrashed against for literally years before figuring out: how to find your niche. Even products that grow to be massive industries start with a few people who are interested enough in it to really get engaged. If there's one thing I wish I had read when starting out making things, it's this essay.</p>

<p>I still find myself forgetting that sometimes.</p>
